Assignment #2

I was able to complete the assignment and all of the pieces.  It went pretty 
well. At first, the interpreter was fairly easy.  Probably going to ask in
class if I did the while loop alright or if need to change it.  Initially did
the for loop with a recursive for loop call but realized that it wasn't doing
what the directions were saying that it should.  Eventually ended up writing
it as a modified while loop, but even that has the weird conditional of
(e2 - x) > -1 instead of (e2-x) >= 0 which I wasn't sure how to do.
It passes the tests but I still may go back to it.

The compiler was really hard.  The first 5 were just copy and paste offering
up a false sense of confidence.  The second that I got to the comparative
operators though, I realized I didn't quite understand what was going on.
Spent a good chunk of time re-reading the directions as well as all of the
code that was in the RegIR file, and finally figured it out.  Still was
a little rocky with the p's vs s's, but eventually got there, good enough
to submit at least. Once I got to the for loop I had a pretty decent grasp
on what was going on. I may go back and re-edit / examen my work so re-submit.
I've already gone over it once and found some spots that weren't covered in
the testing and left some holes open in my code.
